# Matlab Runtime(R2016b) and dotnet docker image.

Docker file has the support of local and remote installation of Matlab runtime. By default, it uses remote installation. That means that during docker container build Matlab runtime will be downloaded from servers all the time. To reduce the time of debugging you can use already downloaded Matlab runtime installer. Follow instructions in docker file to do that.
